          <p>Hey, I'm Noah!</p>
          <p>
            I'm currently a student at CSULB studying Computer Science. I love
            to build, teach, and learn anything related to tech. For the past
            year, I have been working as a coding coach teaching kids aged 8-12
            on the basics of programming. As a coach, I focus on developing
            projects that I have made into small coding lessons and ensuring
            each child progresses in their programming. As someone who is
            constantly looking to expand my skills and knowledge, I'm always
            open to new opportunities to grow and learn in the tech sphere.
